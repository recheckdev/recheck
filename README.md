# Recheck

This is the monorepo for [Recheck](https://recheck.dev), a tool for ensuring prod data is valid.

I'm starting with Ruby and porting to other languages ASAP.
If you want to use Recheck in other languages, please sign up for the mailing list above and tell me which rather than start a clone.
I'm trying hard to make a viable business of this.
