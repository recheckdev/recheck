Beta note:
Recheck is in __early beta__.
You should expect and report crashes, bugs, or missing features.
It is safe to try out because, by design, it does not write to your database.

Please don't submit Recheck to Lobsters/Reddit/Hacker News/etc. yet,
I'd really like it to exercise it and reach 1.0 first.

# Recheck

This is the monorepo for [Recheck](https://recheck.dev), a tool for ensuring prod data is valid.

You probably want to start from [recheck-rails](https://github.com/recheckdev/recheck/tree/main/ruby/recheck-rails).


If you want to use Recheck in other languages, please [sign up for the mailing list](https://buttondown.com/recheck) and email me about which rather than start a clone.
I'm working hard to make a viable business of this.
