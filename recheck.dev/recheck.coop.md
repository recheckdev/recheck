pushcx: I think worker-owned coops are a very good incentive structure for bootstrapped software businesses.

rickychilcott: A la slicing pie or https://www.outseta.com/posts/payment-structure

pushcx: Neither. I don't like the tracking of slicing pie, and Outseta is the standard equity model. This post is misleading because "earn equity in the business at the same rate as our founding team" means they can start grossly disproportionately and also if the "rate" is a percentage they stay that way permanently; and "50% of profits go into a profit sharing pool" but it never mentions what happens to the other half, presumably the founders are disproportionately rewarded.

pushcx: Recheck's design is that
1. only employees can own shares; employees who own shares become "members" (legal term)
2. all employees get 1 share at the end of each full year of employment, max 8. So there is builtin one-year employee -> members training period.
3. founders start with 1 to compensate for risk and because the law requires someone hold shares from the start
4. by law, big decisions like selling the company are one-member-one-vote basis
5. profit sharing happens quarterly; members get a percentage based on number of shares * wages for the quarter.

This doesn't let founders indefinitely take profits that employees earn because I can't justify it. It correctly rewards hiring people at different skill levels, in lower-paying support roles, and part time. It encourages a "profit first" (Michalowicz) approach instead of sweat equity that rewards people who can afford to trade cash for equity.

rickychilcott: Nice. Me and my partners have been on the hunt for a model. We’ve been leaning toward slicing pie because it is fair- but tedious even with their software. 

So this is cool. 

How do you handle cash contributions in your model?

Also, is a year a year? What if have two engineers - one doing a light year of work, someone heads down. And then a marketing person whose fair market value is 1/2 the engineers?


This isn’t a hypothetical scenario. It’s my situation

pushcx: I don't handle cash contributions. It's my spouse and I starting it and the startup cost for software is like... a couple grand for getting this legal design sorted and then $20 to hosting. If it were more capital intensive I would say sell the founders an extra share or two but that's off the top of my head, I dunno.

pushcx: One year is one share. Partly this is keeping the implementation easy to understand. Mostly I handle the differing inputs via wages, so someone earning less as a marketer or earning less by working less will have a smaller multiplier when profit sharing happens.

Ideally I would have a heart-to-heart about expected effort in the first year or two and fire someone who didn't meet expectations. If it's a disagreement between the founders in the first year or two the startup is dead in any equity model.

pushcx: If there is a founder who checked out of a standard equity model business and owns >10%, that startup is dead. It may not know it yet, but it can't raise and the inactive equity is a boat anchor. I've seen it a lot counseling startups.

rickychilcott: Yeah. We’re thinking quarterly discussions about efforts and rectifying shares (or slices) or whatever we decide.

rickychilcott: That’s the nice thing about slicing pie. If you leave because of your choice, your equity vanishes. Feels a bit harsh but the alternative means death.

pushcx: Yeah, hard but fair. I don't know any other way to do it.

I sort of wanted to design a step-down model for departing members where their shares expire over time, say at a rate of 1 per quarter, but then I remembered the couple times I've seen a business need someone to be entirely gone, not a lingering obligation. Hopefully I can pay well enough and include a personal finance counseling benefit so members save wisely!

brandon: this seems very generous

pushcx: I think it is also potentially very competitive against the standard equity model of "you'll like what we give you, which is much less than we give ourselves, and we can change the rules at any time".

This design is sort of funny. I explain it to experienced startup people and they call it socialist. I went to the worker coop conference and they called me a capitalist. Both were derogatory.

pushcx: I mentioned "by law" a couple times, so I should mention which law. Illinois has a legal entity called a "limited worker cooperative association", LWCA. It's a mouthful, but it's an LLC with extra rules on top about who can own shares, etc. This is a decent page that explains IL's several kinds of coops: https://co-oplaw.org/illinois-cooperative-law/ For incorporation and tax aficionados, coop profits are eligible for subchapter t treatment which means dividends aren't double-taxed; details and limitations: https://co-oplaw.org/subchapter-t-patronage-taxation/

rickychilcott: You’re on to something when you offend both extremes…

pushcx: on drugs, probably
